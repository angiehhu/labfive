        <h1>Hello! Welcome to my personal website.</h1>
        <h2>Short paragraph about me.</h2>
        <p>My name's Angela Huang. You might hear some people call me Angie, Ange, G, or big sis.
            I was born and raised here in Metro Vancouver to an immigrant Chinese household. 
            Like any story about being raised with immigrant parents, my first language isn't English; instead, it's Cantonese.
            I'd like to describe myself as a houseplant enthusiast, a proud member of the NUMTOT (new urbanist memes for transit-oriented teens) facebook group, and a musician.
            Drawing while listening to music is one of my favourite hobbies. I like listening to all types of music: from classical to trap rap. However, there is one particular genre of music that I <em>really</em> like to listen to, and that is Jazz music.
