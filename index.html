                    <h2>Short paragraph about me.</h2>
                    <p>My name's Angela Huang. You might hear some people call me Angie, Ange, G, or big sis.
                    I was born and raised here in Metro Vancouver to an immigrant Chinese household. 
                    Like any story about being raised with immigrant parents, my first language isn't English; instead, it's Cantonese.
                    I'd like to describe myself as a houseplant enthusiast, a proud member of the NUMTOT (new urbanist memes for transit-oriented teens) facebook group, and a musician.
                    Drawing while listening to music is one of my favourite hobbies. I like listening to all types of music: from classical to trap rap. However, there is one particular genre of music that I <em>really</em> like to listen to, and that is Jazz music.

                        <h2>My education journey.</h2>
                        <p>After graduating high school, I went to UBC to study environment and sustainability before switching over to BCIT for the CIT program!
                        Currently, I'm in set A of the CIT program that started just this January of this year.
